# Career Compass, part 1: job_scraping
This is a project to scrape details from job ads and save to csv. It has been a great opportunity for me to learn about unit tests, ethical scraping, and using xml sitemaps, as well as working with LLMs to solve problems.

Part 2 (coming soon):
- Clean and prepare the data
- Develop NLP model/embedding of job features
- Deploy user-friendly interface for users to tailor career plans


With thanks to JT for the encouragement!
